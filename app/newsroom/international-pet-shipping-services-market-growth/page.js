              International Pet Shipping Services Market Size, Trends and Latest
              News The global International Pet Shipping Services market was
              valued at approximately USD 1.8 billion in 2022 and is projected
              to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% from 2023
              to 2030. This growth is attributed to the rising pet ownership
              worldwide and increasing international relocations, especially in
              developed regions. The growing demand for pet transport services,
              driven by humanization of pets and the desire for families to
              travel internationally with their animals, is a key factor
              influencing the market&apos;s expansion. Additionally, increasing
              concerns regarding pet safety during travel have prompted
              investments in specialized pet transport and logistics solutions,
              further boosting market growth. Key trends in the market include
              the rise of door-to-door pet shipping services, adoption of
              advanced technologies such as GPS tracking and live video
              monitoring for pets during transit, and a focus on enhanced
              customer service and pet comfort. As regulations for animal travel
              become stricter in some countries, businesses in the market are
              also adapting by offering specialized services to ensure
              compliance with local pet importation rules. The latest news
              indicates a growing trend of pet-friendly airlines and shipping
              companies offering more comprehensive, safe, and stress-free
              travel options for pets. The market&apos;s future growth is also
              influenced by the increasing adoption of pet insurance, which
              helps offset the cost of shipping services for pet owners.
