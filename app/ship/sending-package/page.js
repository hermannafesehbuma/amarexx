                The maximum weight for a Amarex package is 70 lbs. Also, there
                are some things that you can&apos;t send at all (prohibited) and
                other things you can only send under certain conditions
                (restricted). Hazardous materials (HAZMAT) might be prohibited
                or restricted.

              <h4 className=" font-bold my-5">Prohibited Items</h4>
              <p>
                Prohibited Items Some items are prohibited (completely
                forbidden): You can&apos;t send them through Amarex, so
                you&apos;ll have to choose another carrier. Prohibited items
                include:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc mt-5 leading-relaxed">
                <li>Ammunition, explosives, and fireworks</li>

              <h4 className=" font-bold my-5">Restricted Items</h4>
              <p>
                Other items are restricted: You have to follow the rules, stick
                to any limits, and properly package and label your items.
                Restricted items include:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc mt-5 leading-relaxed">
                <li>
                  Lithium batteries (like the ones that come installed inside
                  small electronics, like laptop computers or cell phones) are
                  usually OK to send if the items are new (or a
                  manufacturer-certified repair); if the items are used, they
                  can only be sent via ground transport (can’t go on planes).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Perishable items (like plants or food) are generally OK to
                  send as long as they are properly packaged and won’t spoil or
                  leak.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some items have special packaging requirements, or can only be
                  sent via ground transport, like perfumes containing alcohol.

              </ul>
              <p>
                You have to follow all laws and Amarex® regulations. If you
                don&apos;t follow the rules, you might face fines, or even
                criminal penalties.

                Postage is the price you pay to send something (plus any extra
                services you might buy). It will depend on a few things; you can
                use the Amarex Postage Calculator to see how much you&apos;ll
                need to pay. You can pay for postage at a Post Office; use
                stamps (you might need a lot); or in many cases, even buy
                postage online (and print it yourself) using Click-N-Ship®
                service. Whether you use stamps or printed postage, postage goes
                in the top-right corner of your package.

              <p className="mb-2">
                How you can ship your package depends on a few things, like how
                heavy/thick it is and if you used stamps or not. If your package
                is less than one-half inch thick and weighs less than 10oz, you
                can use postage stamps and drop off your package by:

              <ul className="list-disc mt-5 leading-relaxed my-1">
                <li>Putting it in your mailbox for carrier pickup.</li>
                <li>
                  Dropping it in a blue collection box or Post Office lobby
                  drop-off box.
                </li>
                <li>Requesting a free pickup.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="my-2">
                If your package uses stamps and is more than one-half inch thick
                or weighs more than 10 oz, you must take it to a Post Office
                counter and give it to the Retail Associate at the counter.
              </p>
              <p className="my-2">
                If you printed the postage using Click-N-Ship or at a Amarex
                kiosk, you can use any method to drop off your packages.
              </p>
              <p className="my-2">
                <b>NOTE:</b> If your stamped package is thicker than one-half
                inch or heavier than 10 oz—if you put it in your mailbox for
                pickup, the carrier will leave it. If you drop it in a blue
                collection box or Post Office lobby mail receptacle, it will be
                returned to you.
